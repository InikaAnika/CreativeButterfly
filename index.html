        <div class="row">
            <p>Creativity is usually defined as the ability to solve problems in different ways. Being creative means
                being able to take risks. It means to be able to solve problems in different ways/ innovating new ways,
                and being willing to try new ways. Everyone has creativity inside them, it is just a matter of how much
                they are “capable”/ want to use their creativity.

            <p>
                Why should you be creative? Being creative is a way to stretch your brain while having fun! Yes, you
                still need to do your homework and go to school, but it is good to exercise your brain in different
                ways. Being creative also allows you to solve real world problems, whether it is designing a golf course
                or trying to entertain yourself when you are bored.

            <h4>"Boosting” creativity in Kids</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p> You can “boost” your creativity in different ways. Here are some tips:
            <ol>
                <li>If you have a project where you need to be creative, try to do it before breakfast, if you can’t, do
                    not do the project right after eating.
                </li>
                <li>To be creative you need to be well rested. Keep in mind that I am a kid too, and I love to stay up
                    late, but I am just stating the facts.
                </li>
                <li>Being stressed often affects creativity, so if you can’t get something done in time, ask a teacher
                    for a little more time.
                </li>
                <li>Mindfulness activities can really calm the brain so try one of those if you have time. Mindfulness
                    is not always meditating, it can be coloring in quiet while focusing or doing a craft/ origami that
                    you know.
                </li>
                <li>It is important for kids to know creativity does not mean being perfect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kids often stop trying because they think if they are not good at it the first time round they have
                    failed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is important to show examples to people of how you can become better if you practice. Yes
                    creativity comes with practice too. If you make the same drawing three times you will end up making
                    some new changes to it everytime. That is creativity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is almost required to give kids more materials so that they can choose the material that sparks
                    their imagination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is also important to give lots of examples but let them choose what they want to make either
                    through one of the examples or something based on their imagination. The examples might just prove
                    to be an inspiration to their creativity.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>My experiments</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                I tested out a few different experiments:
            </p>
            <p><h4>First Experiment - Painting while listening to different genres of music</h4></p>

            <p>
                The first experiment was testing what results you would get between 2 different genres of
                music (Classical [violin] or pop [Taylor Swift]). I did this by putting on classical music and then
                painting
                4 paintings, then I put on the pop music and drew 4 more paintings the next day at approximately the
                same
                time of day. The one with Taylor Swift was 3 out of 4 paintings were abstract while the Classical was 2
                out of 4 paintings were abstract. Conclusion for this experiment was that different genres of music can
                lead to different types of creativity. So find your <strong>music as it can definitely boost creativity.</strong>
            </p><br><br>
            <div class="col-md-5 offset-md-1 ">
                <h5>Painting while listening to Classical Music</h5>
                <img src="img/ClassicalMusic.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="Classical Music"> <br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5 offset-md-1 ">
                <h5>Painting while listening to Pop Music</h5>
                <img src="img/PopMusic.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="Pop Music"> <br><br>
            </div>

            <p><h4>Second Experiment - Remote Associates Test</h4></p>
            <p>
                The second experiment was testing whether you were more creative during different times of day.
                We tested this using puzzles called <strong>Remote Associates Test</strong>. These are puzzles where you
                give three words like <strong>fly, salted, cream</strong> you would then see which word fits into all of
                them. In this case <strong>butter</strong>, because it forms butterfly, salted butter, and
                buttercream.The
                result came out better before breakfast. I am not saying to skip your breakfast, but I think <strong>we are most
                creative early in the morning.</strong>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="col-md-5 offset-md-1 ">
                <h5>Day 1</h5>

                <br><br>
            </div>

            <p>
            <h4>Third Experiment - Creativity and Age</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                The third experiment was to see how creativity varies in people of different age groups. I painted this
                image with an adult and a younger child.
                We all saw an image, and then we painted adding our creativity to it. Conclusion for this is that
                creativity has no one definition. Creativity in an adult might be different and for a child it might be
                completely different. Beauty is not creativity. Even though as we get older we might paint perfectly but
                notice how in the little child's version there is snowfall which is creativity in its own unique way.
                <strong>Perfection is not creativity</strong>.
